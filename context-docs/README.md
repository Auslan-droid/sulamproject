# Project Documentation

This folder is your single source of truth for designing and delivering the system. Start with the PRD, then work through the core supporting docs in order.

Recommended order ("first document" marked):

1. PRD – Product Requirements Document (first document)
2. Vision & Scope
3. Roles & Permissions (RBAC)
4. Use Cases & Flows
5. Data Model & ERD
6. Architecture
7. Security & Privacy
8. Audit Logging & Retention (later – see Security & Privacy to start)
9. Reporting Catalog (later)
10. Project Plan & Risks (later)

Quick links:

- Requirements Summary (source input): ../Requirements_Summary.md
- PRD: ./PRD.md
- Vision & Scope: ./Vision-And-Scope.md
- Roles & Permissions: ./Roles-and-Permissions.md
- Use Cases & Flows: ./Use-Cases-and-Flows.md
- Data Model & ERD: ./Data-Model-ERD.md
- Architecture: ./Architecture.md
- Security & Privacy: ./Security-and-Privacy.md

Filling guidance:
- Keep each doc concise and living; link instead of duplicating.
- Capture open questions inline; resolve or move them to Risks/Decisions later.
- Prefer diagrams where they clarify (ERD, flowcharts, or sequence diagrams).

Ownership & versioning:
- Each doc begins with Owner, Status, and Last updated.
- Use PRs for material changes; use checklists for sign-off.
